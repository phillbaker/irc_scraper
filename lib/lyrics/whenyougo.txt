When You Go

Only a moment ago we had nothing but time
Everything lasted forever and you were all mine
Only a dream I know
Thinking you'd never go
Tearing off pieces of myself
Just for the time it buys me

Fold my heart up small
Or break it into pieces
Find somewhere and keep it there
Take it when you go

There in the frame of your face, in the cast of your eyes
I saw this coming but still I am caught by surprise
All of this time I knew
That I'd be losing you
That doesn't mean that it's OK
That doesn't mean I'm ready

Fold my heart up small
Or break it into pieces
Find somewhere and keep it there
Take it when you go

Some things you always remember, some things you forget
No way to make it up now, no room for regret
That's no good for anyone
And so I come undone
Now I am less than what I was
Whatever's left is yours now

So fold my heart up small
Or break it into pieces
Find somewhere and keep it there
Take it when you go
