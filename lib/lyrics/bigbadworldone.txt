Big Bad World One

All alone by the table of food in my wrinkled suit and my borrowed tie
Only thinking of something to say in the moment after the girl walks by
Everyone else is having fun or else pretending to
I eat another crudité

I quit, I'm done
Cause I don't think it's gonna turn out OK
It's no fair, it's no fun
If every time it's gonna end the same way:
Me zero
Big bad world one

At the office we're all having cake cause it's someone's birthday, I don't know who
Got my plate and I'm scanning the room and the only seat is right next to you
I get the nod, the tiny smile that doesn't come with teeth
Maybe you don't know who I am

I quit, I'm done
Cause I don't think it's gonna turn out OK
It's no fair, it's no fun
If every time it's gonna end the same way:
Me zero
Big bad world one

Staying inside, lying in bed
Noticing something that's not there
Follow my heart, follow my head
I'll follow anything that might get me somewhere

Catch her eye when she's pouring my coffee and search my head for an opening line
But I see by the look on her face if I keep my mouth shut I'll save some time
What if the best that I can be just isn't good enough?
Isn't it better not to know?

I quit, I'm done
Cause I don't think it's gonna turn out OK
It's no fair, it's no fun
If every time it's gonna end the same way:
Me zero
