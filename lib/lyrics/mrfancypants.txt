Mr. Fancy Pants

Chances are your pants are not as fancy as the pair
Of very fancy pants that Mr. Fancy Pants will wear
When everybody's marching in the fancy pants parade
He's gonna pass the test
He's gonna be the best
The best in terms of pants

You look in every catalog, you shop at every store
Cause even though you have a hundred pants you want some more
When suddenly you see the greatest pants you've ever seen
And even though you know
It's gonna cost a lot of dough
You have to have the world's best pants

Say a little prayer for Mr. Fancy Pants
The whole world knows
They're only clothes
And deep inside
He's sad

They make the big announcement and the trophy goes to you
You thought you had some fancy pants and now you know it's true
You look at Mr. Fancy Pants and hold the trophy high
Everybody cheers
While he's blinking back the tears
He doesn't even have the best pants

Say a little prayer for Mr. Fancy Pants
It's all he had
But don't feel bad
He'd do the same
To you
