W's Duty

I like duty
Let me talk about duty
Why? Because it needs to get done
This administration has failed to do it
And now, we have an urgent duty
We should do it now
Do it, and do it well
If it feels good do it

Yeah, I'm talking about a massive situation
Let me just...let me just put it to you this way
The situation could hardly get worse
And you know how I know?
I feel this, this terrible sadness
Is there hope for me?
Do I have a chance?
And frankly, do you?

A great duty has been done
This has required extended duty
Sometimes duty is hard
Where there is suffering there is duty
America's duty is familiar
We accept that duty in our time
We must keep our focus
We must do our duty
His purpose is achieved in our duty
And our duty is fulfilled in service to one another
