There's a small town in the mountains where the streets are wide and still
There are children making angels in the snow
The sunset paints the sky at night
An old man works by candlelight
A tiny baby smiles and waves hello
In the cold gray light of dawn an eagle flies
And the men are happy wearing matching ties

A pair of poodles
A broken finger will not bend
Soup with noodles
A female Klingon's drunk boyfriend
A sexy lady
This party's better than it seems

Dear sleeping giant panda: pleasant dreams

A visit to the dentist
A place to get some pie
A rainbow floats above a waterfall
A ferris wheel, a carousel
The landlord never learned to spell
Someone put graffiti on the wall
Atop the Christmas tree, a shining star
And Dwyer's rocking out on air guitar

A freight train passes
Someone's grandma owns a gun
A dog with glasses
A strange balloon man has too much fun
Thumbs up for Slurpees
If you're receiving then you're not gay
A case of herpes
As it turns out the eyepatch is A-OK
